# [ZOOO: A Rotatable Multiple Animatronics Stage](https://www.zhiyima.com/zooo/)

# Introduction
ZOOO is a multi-animatronics stage that can control several animatronics simultaneously. It simplifies the procedure of scripting motions for multi-animatronics as well as enriching interactions between animatronics. With supporting software, interactions like dancing, chatting, chasing, and hide-and-seek can be created quickly and intuitively.

# Features
- Insert and edit motions easily</br>
- Add motion Sequences with one click</br>
- View motions intuitively</br>
- Create various interactions</br>

# Technical Brief
ZOOO.app is built with NW.js, an app which allows us to build native apps with web technologies (HTML, CSS and JavaScript).  In addition, we used Arduino to connect the ZOOO.app with the servo. After ZOOO.app receiving the command from users and sending it to the Arduino controller, an Arduino file (/Arduino/ZOOOToArduinoToUSC32.ino) will be used to analyze and convert the command and send it to the servo controller.

The hardware consists of 3 branches, 3 rotatable panels, 1 rotatable base, 1 Arduino Leonardo board, 1 servo control board, up to 23 servos and 1 power supply system.
